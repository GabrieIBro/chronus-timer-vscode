## Features

There are tons of other extensions like this on VSCode, except this one includes a functionality I didn't find in any other(I actually didn't test many of them :D), the extension can detect if the editor window loses focus and pause the timer automatically.

## Extension Settings

chronus.pauseTimerWhenUnfocused: If this option is checked, the timer will pause automatically when VSCode is out focus.

## Extension Functions

Start Timer
Stop Timer
Show Timer Log
